# WellnessWise_iOS
The primary objective of the proposed project is to develop a mobile application that serves as a
comprehensive guide and navigator for users on their path towards wellness. Through the
utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the application aims to analyze user data and
provide personalized health predictions, recommendations, and insights. By capturing user inputs
such as medical history, lifestyle habits, and real-time health data, the application will leverage
advanced algorithms to assess health risks, predict potential outcomes, and offer actionable
strategies for improving overall well-being. The overarching goal is to empower users to make
informed decisions about their health and lifestyle choices, leading to better health outcomes and
enhanced quality of life.


Following will be some of the main requirements of this project.
Functional Requirements:

User Registration and Profile Creation:
• Allow the user to register an account by using his mobile number or email. To verify
the user, make sure to use OTP verification mechanism so that the user can only
register using his own information (mobile number or Email).
• Allow users to create a profile by providing basic information such as age, gender,
height, weight, medical history, and lifestyle habits.
• Capture additional health parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar
levels, and cholesterol levels.

Health Data Input:
• Enable users to input real-time health data using integrated sensors or manual input.
• You should use data synchronization APIs1 to support synchronization with wearable
devices and health tracking apps for seamless data integration.
AI-based Health Prediction:
• Implement AI and ML algorithms2 to analyze user data and predict potential health
outcomes.
• Consider factors such as health parameters, lifestyle habits, environmental factors,
and medical history.

Personalized Recommendations:
• Provide personalized recommendations for lifestyle modifications, diet adjustments,
exercise routines, and preventive measures based on predicted health risks.
• Offer actionable insights and strategies to help users improve their overall health and
well-being.
Health Monitoring and Alerts:
• Enable continuous health monitoring and tracking of key health parameters.
• Send timely alerts and notifications to users regarding potential health risks or
deviations from normal health indicators.

Data Visualization:
• Present health predictions and trends through interactive charts, graphs, and
visualizations.
• Provide users with a clear understanding of their health status and progress over time.

Health Risk Assessment:
• Conduct comprehensive health risk assessments based on user data and predictive
analytics.
• Evaluate risks for chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,
hypertension, and cancer.
